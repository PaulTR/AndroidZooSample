# AndroidZooSample
This is a sandbox project for me to try various Android libraries, architectures, patterns, tools, etc. The main reason I'm putting this together is that I've been doing a lot more IoT in my free time, so I needed a project that I can build out modularly to try things as the Android platform grows. Base project follows Google's suggested way to build an app, then I'm trying new things on top of that. Some things in this app (either already in, or I'm getting to it):

* JetPack recommendations
* Android X
* Testing
* Navigation component
* Firebase
* Repository pattern
* Kotlin Binding
* Koin or some other DI
* TensorFlow ML Kit
* QR Codes
* Video
* Audio sessions
* Casting
* Firebase analytics
* Firebase messaging
